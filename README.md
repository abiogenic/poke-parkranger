# POKÉ PARK RANGER

### What:

You are a newly hired Safari Zone park ranger. You join your starter, a pokémon you brought with you from home, to help you complete ranger duties (ex. deterring poaching, caring for sick pokémon, and educating the public) and research (ex. pokémon behavior, environmental changes, and ecological interactions).

### Goals:

To have an outlet to practice Python and machine learning fundamentals

To have something demonstrable for my friends and family to understand what I do as a bioinformaticist
